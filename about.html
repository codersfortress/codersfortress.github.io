            <p class="about-p">CodeFortress was created as your one stop shop for all your tech needs!<br>
            Meet your tech jason, his humble journey began at Rio Hondo studying IT and graduating <br>
            with two degrees! a cybersecurity degree and a computer systems degree, <br>
            but he did not stop there, jason is currently pursuing his bachelors in cybersecurity and <br>
            information assurance, while collecting a CompTIA A+ Certification along the way. <br>
            What started as a love for cybersecurity turned into a passion for programming and website <br>
            developement. He figured, if he could build his own website AND set up an deploy his own small <br>
